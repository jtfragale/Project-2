# Planning

## What I'm building:

I'm going to build an app that lets users view available hikes and store ones they have been on in Shenandoah National Park . It will have the following features.

-show page for recommended hikes in the park
-user authentication (sign up and sign in)
-add a hike
-delete a hike
-add pictures???



## User Stories

-as a user, I want to be able to creat an account, so that I can save all of my hikes
-as a user, I want to create and save a hike, so that I can keep track of all my hikes
-as a user, I want to be able to edit my hikes, so that I can add new things about a hike



## MVP

-ability to create/add hikes

## Bronze

## Silver

-separate page for user that stores their hikes

## Gold
